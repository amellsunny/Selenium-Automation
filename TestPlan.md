# T-Mobile Website UI Testing Plan



## Objective

The objective of this test plan is to validate T-Mobile's website functionality and UI consistency using Selenium WebDriver in Java. 
Automated tests focus on the critical areas (Home, Shop, Deals, Support, Account, and Footer) to ensure smooth navigation, functional filters, account handling, and footer element interactions, ultimately promoting a user-friendly experience.



## Scope

### Inclusions

This plan includes testing the following main sections and functions:

- **Pages**: Home, Shop, Deals, Support, Account, Footer
- **Functionality**: Navigation, search, filtering, login/logout, footer links, and social media redirects

### Exclusions

Non-essential pages or features not affecting the core site usability (e.g., internal tools or support widgets).


## Test Environments

Testing will be conducted on Google Chrome on desktop environments, with potential future expansion to additional browsers or devices.

- **Browsers**: Google Chrome (latest version)
- **Operating Systems**: Windows 10



## Defect Reporting Procedure

Defects will be documented in GitHub Issues (or Jira), with detailed reproduction steps and categories (e.g., UI, functionality). They will be prioritized by impact and severity, with regular updates shared with stakeholders.



## Test Strategy

### Approach

- **Test Design Techniques**: Employing Boundary Value Analysis, Equivalence Partitioning, and exploratory testing to ensure thorough coverage.
- **Execution**: Full test execution for every stable build, with defect review and re-testing as needed.

### Testing Types

1. **Functional Testing**: To validate key features.
2. **Regression Testing**: Ensuring fixes donâ€™t impact existing functionality.
3. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Focusing initially on Chrome.



## Test Schedule

### Tasks

- **Test Plan Creation**: 1 week
- **Test Case Development**: 1-2 weeks
- **Test Execution and Reporting**: Continuous, aligned with release cycles

### Timeline

Testing will proceed in bi-weekly sprints, with regular summary reports and coverage reviews.



## Test Deliverables

- **Test Cases**: Created using TestNG and stored in GitHub.
- **Reports**: TestNG-generated reports providing detailed execution results.



## Entry and Exit Criteria

### Entry Criteria

- Approved setup for test environment.
- Application accessible and ready for testing.

### Exit Criteria

- Full test case execution.
- All critical defects logged or resolved.



## Tools

- **Automation**: Selenium WebDriver, TestNG, Maven
- **Defect Tracking**: GitHub Issues or Jira



## Risks and Mitigations

- **Risk**: UI changes may disrupt locators.
  - **Mitigation**: Frequent maintenance of scripts.
- **Risk**: Browser-specific issues.
  - **Mitigation**: Expanding testing to additional browsers as needed.



## Approvals

Documents (Test Plan, Test Cases, and Reports) require QA lead and project manager approval before moving forward.
